# Utility Functions
 - These are a set of functions I used to open, copy, convert and save data to different formats including json, tsv, csv, xlsx.
 - I've created a test set to check all the current functions to ensure they work as expected.

## ToDo 
 - Create readable documentation 
 - Make into a package
