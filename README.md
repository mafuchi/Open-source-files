# Open-source-files

This repo is for all the python scripts I wrote doing phonology/semantic reseach.  
Hopefully it will be useful to someone in someway (even if it's not what to do).
I will be updating as I have more scripts looking less awful.

### Commandline
This section is command line scripts I wrote to convert data from a tsv file to JSON to Dataframe for analysis in scikitlearn

### Stubs
These are bits I sometimes add to my scripts, to make it more than just a function.
