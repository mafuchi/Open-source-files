# Open-source-files

This repo is for all the python scripts I wrote for personal projects.  
I am organizing theme for myself, but maybe they will be useful for someone else.  


## Class

 - Functions I've used to organize or check data
 - This will be updated as I work through the backlong of scripts I've written for personal projects.
 - 

## Commandline [Old]

This section is command line scripts I wrote to convert data from a tsv file to JSON to Dataframe for analysis in scikitlearn

## Stubs [Old]

These are bits I sometimes add to my scripts, to make it more than just a function.
